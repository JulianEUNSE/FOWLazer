# FOWLazer

A Phaser-based browser game that I am creating as a side hobby.

# Getting started

1. Clone the repository
``` git clone https://github.com/JulianEUNSE/FOWLazer.git ```

2. Install Dependencies
``` npm install ```
``` npm install phaser ```

3. Run the development server

From here, you can follow the link to open the game on your own localhost.
